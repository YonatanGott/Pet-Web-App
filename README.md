# Pet Adopt and Foster Web-App

This is a web app for adopting and fostering pets

## Design

THe web app is designed with the help of Materialize framework.
It is a responsive design, that I hope looks good on mobile devices.
The pet cards are BIG - each pet should get the users full attention.

### Scalable issues

Image input for the pets accepts one photo per pet, but images are set up as an array for later upgrades.
Pagination is not implemented yet.

### Server

Currently cookies only work on localhost.
Deployed on Heroku
